# data_exploration_project
I started playing around with SQL recently, and this is my attempt at working with real-life data

The dataset was obtained from Our World in Data - Coronavirus(COVID-19) deaths. [https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths?country=~NGA](url)

This project aims to understand the data and uncover some trends and patterns.

First of all, I split the data into two:
1. Covid deaths
2. Covid Vaccinations
The reason for this is so that I can perform some 'JOINS' statements while writing my query.

Many thanks to Alex the Analyst for his tutorial videos on SQL.
